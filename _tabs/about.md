Here is the complete documentation for my homelab, mostly for myself but others may find it useful also!

It includes Kubernetes Manifests and/or Docker Compose examples for services that I am currently running

My Homelab is currently quite small compared to some, but it does what I need ðŸ˜€.

Check out my [F9-K8S Terraform/FluxCD GitHub Repo](https://github.com/fma965/f9-k8s) for the latest configurations
